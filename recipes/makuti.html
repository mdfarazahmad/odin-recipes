    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Makuti is a traditional sweet dish of Bihar. Bihari cuisine is a combination of Bhojpuri cuisine, Maithil cuisine and Magahi cuisine. The original version of makuti is prepared during Muslim marriages in Bihar, mostly in Patna. It is served in a special bowl called 'dhakni'. In the marriage dinners of Bihar, hundreds of these makuti filled dhaknis are arranged in a row on the tables for people, to have them dessert. You can find this dish on the streets of Bihar but it is really very difficult to find it anywhere else than Bihar. Vegans can also prepare this dessert using coconut oil.</p>
